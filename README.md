# Fractals
An exploration of fractals with several mini-projects.

# Projects
- FractalClock: A clock but the clock is copied to all its hands. See CodeParade's FractalClock (<https://github.com/HackerPoet/FractalClock>) to see the equivalent for a timer.
- Mandelbrot: A quick plot of the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane. Includes navigation features so you can zoom it and do all that weird trippy stuff.
